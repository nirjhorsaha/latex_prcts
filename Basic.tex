Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. \textbf{Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.} It has survived not only five centuries, \underline{but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.} It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like \textbf{\textit{ Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.}}
